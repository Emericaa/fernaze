# Hey there!

 I'm Tiago Azevedo, and I've been captivated by the world of technology ever since I got my hands on a Motorola C520 and a Gameboy back in the day. Those early gadgets sparked a lifelong passion that has led me down many exciting paths in the tech realm.

At the heart of my tech journey lies my home lab, a space where I can unleash my inner mad scientist and dive deep into all things tech. From tinkering with Docker containers and Kubernetes to exploring the latest in cybersecurity and networking, my home lab is my sanctuary of discovery.

One of my most ambitious projects to date has been customizing my Home Assistant setup. It's been a labor of love, tweaking and fine-tuning every aspect to create a seamless and personalized smart home experience. From controlling lights and appliances to monitoring security cameras, my Home Assistant is the hub that brings it all together.

Beyond my home lab adventures, I spend my days as a Cloud Administrator at a tech-focused venture capital firm. It's a fast-paced environment where no two days are ever the same. From managing cloud infrastructures to troubleshooting complex technical issues, I thrive on the challenges that come my way.

Lately, I've been delving deeper into the world of DevSecOps, with a particular focus on the operational security (SecOps) aspect. I firmly believe that blending security seamlessly into our operations is the key to building robust and resilient systems for the future. It's a fascinating journey that combines my passion for technology with my commitment to keeping data safe and secure.

Outside of the tech world, you can find me enjoying quality time with my family or engaging in various outdoor activities. I'm a big fan of hitting the Padel courts, taking refreshing swims, and tackling some mountain biking trails. It's all about finding balance and enjoying life beyond the screen.

I'm excited to share my tech adventures and insights with you, so stick around! Let's navigate the ever-changing landscape of technology together and see where the journey takes us.
